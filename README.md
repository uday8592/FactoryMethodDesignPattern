# Factory Method Design Pattern

This repository demonstrates the Factory Method design pattern. The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. It promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.

## Contents

- Example implementations of the Factory Method pattern (language: Java)
- Simple sample usages and unit tests (if present)

## Project Structure

- src/ - source code
- README.md - this file

## How to build & run

If this is a Java project using a build tool (Maven/Gradle), build with your preferred tool. Example using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean compile
mvn test
```

If the project is plain Java source files, you can compile and run with:

```bash
# compile
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")
# run (example)
java -cp out com.example.Main
```

Replace the package and main class name with the project's actual entry point.
